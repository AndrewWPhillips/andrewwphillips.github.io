# Blog site

This is my Github Pages web site, that I use for a blog.

It uses Jekyll (required by Github pages) with Minimal Mistakes theme using [their starter project](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter)

# Troubleshooting

This is left over from the original readme - not sure if it's usefult yet.

- [Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.

# Testing

$ bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
