# Blog site

This is my Github Pages web site, that I use for a blog.

It uses Jekyll (required by Github pages) with Minimal Mistakes theme using [their starter project](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter)

# Troubleshooting

## Changes don't appear

- check they are committed AND pushed
- wait a few minutes
- check that build was OK - Actions tab on github repo

## View drafts

$ bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
