This blog is just about Go, but each post will have some background info. that is not required reading.

# Background

**About Me**

I've been developing software for more than 40 years (mainly C and C++) - using Go for 6 years now.

<div style="float: right; width: 200px;"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg"/></div>

In the past I've also been the author of magazine articles (C/C++ Users Journal etc), and in 2011 I started a general software development blog (see [Software Development Methodologies](https://devmethodologies.blogspot.com/)).  I've also written a few popular open-source projects ([Github](https://github.com/andrewwphillips)).

More recently, I've been writing about Go, and spoken at the [Sydney Go Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/golang-syd/) a few times.

**Looking for a New Great Language**

I learnt C++ in 1987.  In 2015 I had been programming in it for about 20 years, but was frustrated that I still did not feel entirely proficient in it.

There is a lot I love about C++ such as the STL.  C++11 had a lot of new useful stuff such as lambdas (that made the STL even better).

The trouble was there was just too much stuff, especially all the inheritance rules that I could never remember.

So I was looking for a new language to concentrate on.  I looked at Go and Rust, and rejected Go because it had:

* no parametric polymorphism (ie, generics)
* GC (I'd had bad experiences with Java & C#)
* I did not realise it *had* lambdas (closures)
* Go slices were not as simple as I expected
* it seemed to be missing obvious stuff
* Google had too much control (bad impression)

I liked Rust especially its innovative memory/resource management.  Also, it had something akin to the STL.

So I learnt Rust and started looking for a way to use it.

**New Job**

In January 2017 I got a new C++ job in a group that created software infrastructure, supporting several other groups using different languages (Python, Delphi, C#, Java, PHP, ...).  They also seemed keen on Rust.

A few months into the job they put me on a project to support another language, but it turned out to be Go not Rust.  My first task was to write C++ code to generate Go code then I created a Go package to support our message passing infrastructure.  It only took me a few weeks to realise that my initial impression of Go was way off track.

**Complexity**

I started my previous blog 12 years ago.  It was a response to a general uneasiness I had - that creating software continues to become more and more (unnecessarily) complex.

My very first blog post (see [Handling Software Complexity](https://devmethodologies.blogspot.com/2011/10/handling-software-design-complexity.html)) concluded that the way to conquer complexity is to use the principle of **divide and conquer**.

Of course, there's more to it, which I got into with later blog posts about "Agile" development - talking about things like [automated testing ("unit testing")](https://devmethodologies.blogspot.com/2014/03/unit-tests-summary.html), [emergent design](https://devmethodologies.blogspot.com/2014/05/agile-design.html) and the [wild goose chase of reusability](https://devmethodologies.blogspot.com/2012/11/reusability-futility.html).

**Simplicity of Go**

It wasn't until I started using Go that I realised that the programming language is a critical part of the solution.  Other languages make software development more complex; Go (and it's infrastructure) really makes things simpler.

# Why Go?

My first impression of Go (8 years ago) was disappointment -- this seems to be the experience of a lot of people.  It was not until I started to use it (2 years later) that I started to get it.

When I think back over decades of coding, I really appreciate how much simpler my life is, now that I mainly use Go.

I'm not just talking about coding (though that is also simpler).  I mean all the problems I used to spend 90% of my time on - compatibility, upgrading, portability, maintenance, testing, documenting, etc.  Even just upgrading to a new compiler release could be a nightmare - a problem Go has virtually eliminated.

There are many reasons I would _now_ choose to use Go over other languages. Some are well recognized; some (which I hope to share) are not generally appreciated.

## Favourite Go Feature

Like everyone who uses Go, I wish it had some feature(s) that I have used in some other language.

But, somewhat paradoxically, my favourite feature of Go is that it does *not* have my favourite features.  Avoiding the bells and whistles has allowed the language to stay simple (to use).

**My favourite Go feature is how simple it makes everything.**

# Why another Go Blog?

There are already a lot of Go blogs (good and bad :);  I'm not trying to compete with them, but fill in the gaps.  Eg, things like I'm thinking of are:

* coping with insufficient memory
* optimization, such as PGO, inlining, ...
* GC issues
* goroutine preemption
* processor affinity
* escape analysis
* useful uses of generics
* etc.

There are also occasionally concepts in Go that I have seen explained poorly (or not at all).

I'll also keep an eye on new developments in [Go issues](https://github.com/golang/go/issues), [golang-nuts](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts) and the [official Go blog](https://go.dev/blog/), and elsewhere.

## The Silver Gopher

Some reasons I started **The Silver Gopher**:

* having a blog solely focussed on Go will attract the audience I am trying to help
* my [old blog](https://devmethodologies.blogspot.com/) is looking a bit tired
* I want to help others to learn, and _appreciate_ Go
* address that Go is misrepresented (to the uninitiated)

## Why Silver?

Some people consider Go to be a "second class" language, like the way **silver is considered inferior to gold**.

In fact, silver has far more uses than gold.  (<span style="color: purple;">Fun fact:</span> silver is the best conductor of all the metals?) 

There are <span style="color: brown;">gold</span> languages that are more superficially attractive and showy than Go.  But, like silver, Go is unembellished and far more useful.

# Conclusion

That's all for now, but there will be more soon.

I hope you enjoy reading the blog as much as I (will) enjoy writing it.
