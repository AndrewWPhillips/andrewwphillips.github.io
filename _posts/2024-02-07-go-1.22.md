I have been using Go 1.22 RC1 for a while.  There are some cute changes to `for` loops and the standard library and some nice optimizations, including some for [PGO](https://andrewwphillips.github.io/blog/pgo.html).

I look at these things below including a gotcha that I first encountered 20 years ago (when first using C# lambdas).  For some reason it seems to cause a lot of angst to new Gophers - see [capture of loop variables](#capture-of-loop-variables).

One major thing that seems to have slipped under the radar is that the Go [execution tracer](#execution-tracer) has been overhauled (dare I say fixed :).  Most significantly (at least to me) is that issues with traces not being able to be displayed due to **time stamps out of order** no longer occur.

The **execution tracer** is an amazing tool (unique to Go) which allows you to understand in detail what your goroutines are doing and how they are interacting with each other, the garbage collector, OS, etc.

Some new abilities were also added to the tracer, such a streaming and coordination with higher-level traces.  And the Go **trace tool** (used to view execution traces) has some nice improvements.

**C# Capture of loop variables**

When I first tried lambdas in C# (about 20 years ago), I discovered something unexpected.  When you create lambdas within a loop which captures the loop variable they all capture the _same_ variable. After the loop has completed all the captured variables have the same value -- the final value of the loop variable. What I, and apparently others, expected was the captured variable would reflect the value of the loop variable at the time of capture.

The C# behaviour makes sense because there is only one loop variable and variables captured in lambdas are references to the original variable.  However, it seemed to me that a special case could be made for loop variables - ie if captured then a _copy_ of the current loop variable value could be captured.

I haven't used C# in yonks, so I am not sure if this has been addressed, but I suspect not.

**Go Capture of loop variables**

When I first captured a loop variable in a Go closure, I was alert to the issue with the capture of loop variables from my prior experience with C# (see above).

But I was a bit surprised that the Go designers had not learnt from use of other languages like C# and captured a _copy_ of the loop variable.  I assumed the decision was made for some reason such as efficiency.  It also acted as a strong reminder, once you fell in the trap, that variables are captured by reference!

This problem seems to affect Go newbies more than other languages.  I suspect that this is because of how much easier it is to use concurrency -- I think all Gophers have started a new goroutine in a loop like this:

```go
   for i := range s {
      go func() {
         println(i)
      }()
   }
```
The output of this loop is undefined as it Go does not say when each new goroutine, created in the loop, will run.  Depending on when they run it might print 0 1 2 3... or 5 5 5 9 99 .... Usually, the loop terminates before any goroutine runs, and it just prints the final value of `i`.

In other words, the `func` or "closure" running in the goroutine captures `i` as a reference to the original `i`.  This could be addressed by taking a copy of `i` - conventionally done using a local variable of the same name. 

```go
   for i := range s {
      go func() {
         i := i
         println(i)
      }() 
   }
```

Another way be to take a copy of `i` using a parameter.

```go
   for i := range s {
      go func(arg int) {
         println(arg)
      }(i)
   }
```

# Loops

There have been two enhancements to `for` loops in Go 1.22.

## Capture of Loop Variables

A common mistake for new Gophers is to capture a loop variable in a goroutine, expecting it to retain the value at the time of capture.

Despite numerous explanations in popular blogs saying so, this has **nothing to do with goroutines**, though that is how most people encounter the issue - as in the example in [Background/Go](#background) above.

For example, this code demonstrates the issue without involving goroutines.

```go
   var s []func()
   for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
      s = append(s, func() { println(i) })
   }
   for _, f := range s {
      f()
   }
```

### Go Vet

Note that `go vet` will warn you of the problem.

### Go 1.22 Change

Go 1.22 changes the behaviour so the captured variable is a copy of the loop variable.  In others words before Go 1.22 this prints the final value of the loop variable.

```
3
3
3
```
but in Go 1.22 it prints
```
0
1
2
```

{: .notice-warning}
**Note** The change in Go 1.22 does not just affect closures but any use of the address of the loop variable.

### Backward Compatibility

This different behaviour means that Go 1.22 is **not backward compatible**.

Go is renowned for its backwards compatibility so **how can this be?**  After all it's possible that there is code out there that depends on the behaviour to behave correctly.  Well, it seems most code is not affected - see [How often does the change break real programs?](https://go.dev/wiki/LoopvarExperiment#my-test-fails-with-the-change-how-can-i-debug-it:~:text=.-,How%20often%20does%20the%20change%20break%20real%20programs%3F,-Empirically)

But just in case the Go the compiler is backward compatible as long as you do not update the go version number in your `go.mod` file past `go 1.21`.  Of course, sooner or later you might need to use Go 1.22, whence you will have to change your code (or verify that the changed behaviour has no effect or even makes your code better :).

## Range Over Integers

Another change to loops in Go 1.22 is the ability to loop over integers.  So instead of this very common sort of code:

```go
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { ... }
```

you can do this:

```go
    for i := range 10 { ... }
```

Unless I am missing something, I can't see much difference.  (I'll try to remember to use it, but after 4 decades of C, etc I think my loop code is too ingrained :)

## Range Over Function (preview)

The ability to range over a function is more useful, but it is not part of the language (yet).  It is included in 1.22 as a **preview** and I suspect that it will change significantly before it becomes part of the language proper.

It seems that the Go team are trying to address Go's inability to add efficient user-defined iterators.  This has become more urgent with the advent of generics, since they allow containers to be created that could benefit from iterators.  However, I suspect that efficient iterators will eventually find there way into the language through Coroutines - see [Coroutines for Go](https://research.swtch.com/coro).

# Runtime

## Execution Tracer

In the past I have had a love/hate relationship with the execution tracer.  For simple things it did an amazing job but for some real production issues I found collecting and viewing traces slow and confusing.  Large traces had to be split for viewing.

Worst of all, most production traces could not be viewed.  When I tried them in the trace tool I would get a message **time stamps out of order**.

I am very happy to report that these problems have been addressed.  Gathering traces has less impact on performance.  Larger traces are easier to be view and less likely to need splitting.

There are also some other improvements as a result of the complete overhaul.  You can now stream traces as they are generated, rather than having to save a complete trace to file.

One enhancement that I am keen to try is that these low-level traces can coordinate with "high-level" tracing tools such as Open Telemetry.

# Standard Library

## Random Numbers

There is a new `math/rand/v2` package intended to replace `math/rand`.  It's nice to have a generic versions of `rand.IntN()` that works with any integer type.  For serious randomness you should probably be using `crypto/rand`.

## HTTP Routing

There have been many problems with the standard library HTTP muxer or router.  This is why there are numerous open-source alternatives out there.  However, I have modest requirements (and prefer GraphQL) so generally use the standard library `net/http` package, so the new features are nice if a long time coming.

From my understanding it has the following new features but does not address other issues related to performance and security.
* method matching - previously you had to manually check that a handler was called for the correct HTTP method (PUT, POST, etc)
* wildcards/variables in paths - provides greater flexibility (as in almost all open-source routers)

# Conclusion

With these improvements I think the Go Execution Trace will be used much more, at least by me.  I have already used it to verify the source of a very obscure performance issue in production.  I hope to write something soon about using the Go's execution tracer as it is such an amazingly useful tool.

I haven't mentioned the numerous other changes and fixes to the tools, standard library, etc.  See [Release Notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22) for details.
